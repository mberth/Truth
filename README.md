# Truth

Truth is type-safe data language for allowing big, complex, and non-uniform (aka "jagged") data sets to be organized with relative ease. The entire language is 2 operators: `:` and `,`. Using this seemingly spartan (but deceivingly powerful) syntax, you're able to make *is-a* and *has-a* statements of existence. From these statements, you can model domains of any complexity. And, your model is verified for logical soundness.

Once your domain is modelled, Truth provides a natural way to attach "agents", which are plugin-like packages that analyst the host file, and emit various digital asset, such as mobile apps, reporting tools, visualization tools, etc. The Truth mindset allows this to happen quite easily (documentation coming).

Truth is not someone's side project. We have financial backing from enterprise customers who are using it for their mission critical operations.
