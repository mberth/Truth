// Inline covariance is *not* a way to merely transfer the
// patterns from to one type to another, although this 
// happens as a side effect of the inline covariance feature.
// This example demonstrates a failure case of incorrect
// usage of the feature. Note that although it may seem as
// though this could made to verify, doing so would change
// the meaning of "inline covariance", resulting in a series
// of undesirable cascading effects.
